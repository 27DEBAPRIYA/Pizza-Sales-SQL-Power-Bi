#This is a Pizza Sales Report of a Shop

Where I get the data from internet.
Using SQL I just get the overview of my data, then I created a Power Bi Report
I made some KPI's like 
                    1. Total Revenue
                    2.Average Order Value
                    3.Total Pizza Sold
                    4.Total Orders
                    5.Average Pizza/Order

Using DAX I create some Funtional Rows, Measures. Also I created a seperate Table for all the measures.
This multipage report shows you a complete over view of pizza sales for a perticular year

```Hope you will get the valuable insights from this Report```
